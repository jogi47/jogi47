# Jigar Patel

I build systems. I break assumptions. I ship.

### What I Believe
Software is a craft. The best engineers I know treat code like writing - they revise, they delete, they obsess over clarity. I've spent 14 years learning that the hardest problems aren't technical. They're about people, priorities, and knowing when to say no.
I don't chase trends. I chase understanding.

### What I'm Learning

**Agentic AI** - Not the hype. The hard parts. How do you build AI systems that fail gracefully? How do you evaluate agents that don't have deterministic outputs? How do you keep token costs from exploding?
**System Design at Scale** - After 14 years, I'm still learning. Every large system teaches you something new about tradeoffs. I'm currently obsessed with observability - the idea that you can't fix what you can't see.
**The Art of Simplicity** - The older I get, the more I value code deletion over code creation. The best architecture is the one your team can maintain. Not the one that looks clever on a whiteboard.

### What I've Shipped
High-stakes platforms where failure isn't an option: real-money transactions, exchange systems, products serving millions. Fintech taught me about correctness. Sportsbook taught me about scale. EdTech taught me about impact.
